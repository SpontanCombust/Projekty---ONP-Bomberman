; Every line until the key content in file will be automatically
; skipped over if it begins with ';'
; You can then add your credentials here and so on
; File needs to have a strict structure atm
; I don't think I'll have time to make it more approachable
; Headers have to be there and content has to be written correctly
; 
; 1st header - [quantity]
; Below it you write 'n=x', where x is the number of available paths
; You can add any amount of enemy paths you want
; 2nd header - [paths]
; Below it you write paths one by one
; Paths line begins with a number that says how many steps does a path have
; After the step quantity you write your steps
; Step is 'x,y' where x and y are tile coordinates on the map
; 0,0 is the tile in the upper left corner
; By going right from it you go in positive x axis
; By going down from it you go in positive y axis
;
; Here's an example taken from Level 1
